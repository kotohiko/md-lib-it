# Chapter 1   Getting Ready







You will learn about the following in this chapter: 

- C’s history and features
- The steps needed to write programs
- A bit about compilers and linkers
- C standards

Welcome to the world of C—a vigourous[^1], professional programming language popular with amateur[^2] and commercial programmers alike.  This chapter prepares you for learning and using this powerful and popular language, and it introduces you to the kinds of environments in which you will most likely develop your C-legs[^3].

First, we look at C’s origin and examine some of its features, both strengths and drawbacks. Then we look at the origins of programming and examine some general principles for programming. Finally, we discuss how to run C programs on some common systems. 

[^1]: very active, determined or full of energy
[^2]:[usually before noun] doing sth for pleasure or interest, not as a job.
[^3]:The term **"C-legs"** is a playful metaphor derived from the phrase **"sea legs."** "Sea legs" originally refers to the ability to keep one's balance and move comfortably on a ship after spending some time at sea. In this context, "C-legs" metaphorically describes the ability to become comfortable and proficient in using the C programming language. So, in this sentence, "develop your C-legs" means learning to navigate and work effectively in C, transitioning from a beginner to someone who is skilled and confident in the language. It adds a bit of humor and vivid imagery to the explanation.



## Whence C?

**Dennis Ritchie** (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) of Bell Labs created C in 1972 as he and **Ken Thompson** (February 4, 1943 —) worked on designing the UNIX operating system. C didn’t spring full-grown from Ritchie’s head, however. It came from Thompson’s B language, which came from... but that’s another story. The important point is that C was created as a tool for working programmers, so its chief goal is to be a useful language. 

Most languages aim to be useful, but they often have other concerns. The main goal for Pascal, for instance, was to provide a sound basis for teaching good programming principles. BASIC, on the other hand, was developed to resemble English so that it could be learned easily by students unfamiliar with computers. These are important goals, but they are not always compatible with pragmatic, workaday usefulness. C’s development as a language designed for programmers, however, has made it one of the modern-day languages of choice.
